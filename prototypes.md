An archive of prototypes that didn't become full games.

### Clock Game (2023)

Time advances for entities when they're hit by the clock hand.

Here the player plants saplings that grow into trees as they get hit by the clock. When the sun is hit by the clock it switches to rain which trigger the grown tree to spawn fruit.

In a later iteration, I allowed the player to pick up entities. The idea was that it would turn into a fast paced farming game where you create combos by arranging things next to eachother.

Another feature was that the player would change age if it hit the clock hand. Kid mode prefers to eat different produce and runs faster but adult can carry heavier things. In the gif below the player hits the clock hand from behind as a kid and down-age into a baby. They have to wait for the clock hand to come back around so that they can move age-up and move again.

Edit in 2025: We actually ended up making a jam game called [Tiny Time](https://dorodo.itch.io/tiny-time) related to this idea!

### Cauldron Game (2022)

Craft hats by throwing enemy remains into a cauldron. The hats give you combo attacks based on the ingredients they were made with.

Here the player starts with an (explosion + chain-lighting) attack and then switches to an (explosion + explosion) attack by crafting a new hat.
