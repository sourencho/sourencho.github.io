I heard about [The Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) from a friend and applied with the hopes of exploring creative coding in a structured and social setting.

> The Recurse Center is a self-directed, community-driven educational retreat for programmers based in New York City.

<br>

It turned out to be a fantastic decision. I learned a ton, made great friends and came out with the skills, knowledge and determination to pursue game development as a career.

I still hang out with the community on their servers :)

During my batch and a half which lasted 4.5 months I studied and worked on these things:

<br>

# Game Development

### Games

- Worked on the networking and shaders of [ungroup](https://github.com/sourencho/ungroup_game) (a multiplayer game with a custom engine). Pairing with friends helped a lot.
<br>

- Organized a game jam and made the first version of [mimic](https://sourencho.itch.io/mimic) with a friend.
<br>

- Worked a bit with a friend on their open-world unity game where you can freely talk to NPCs using a language system.
<br>

- Started a Game Dev Interest Group at RC with a friend which I still attend a year and a half later!

<br>

### Graphics

- Wrote [a rasterizer](https://github.com/sourencho/rogue_rasterizer) from scratch with a friend using the [Scratchapixel tutorial](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/rasterization-practical-implementation).
<br>

- Made [an environment](https://github.com/sourencho/jaragayt) to implement solutions to 3D math problems in opengl for practice using [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/).
<br>

- Read through some of [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/).
<br>

- Attending a raymarching workshop and implemented [marching in PICO-8](https://github.com/sourencho/pico-march).
<br>



<br>

### Math
- Read through almost all of [3D math primer for graphics and game development](https://g.co/kgs/AcMG8g) and worked on the problems.

<br>

### Unity

- Worked through [many](https://github.com/sourencho/catlike_coding_unity) of the [Catlike Coding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) tutorials to gain a better understanding of Unity.

<br>

# Creative Coding

### Livecoding

- Created a [livecoding environment](https://github.com/sourencho/jrots) in atom using [hydra](https://github.com/ojack/hydra) and [p5](https://p5js.org/) that produces typographic visuals from midi input.
<br>

- Messed around with [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/) and made a short [procedural song](https://github.com/sourencho/tidals/blob/master/songs/soothing_random_pents.tidal).
