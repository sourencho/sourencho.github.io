## C: Add the seam

1. Gather all stitches on one needle and add two rows of seam.

## D: Sow shut

1. Invert the slipper and sow it shut such that the outward facing part is enclosed. Use the extended yarn from the seam.
2. Once you're done, invert it back and cut the end of the yarn. Close it out.

## E: Create the base

1. Create the base by adding an extra row for every 2 columns and then once at the peak reduce a row for every two columns until you have the shape shown below. You might need to adjust how often you add/reduce, 2 works for most slippers.

## F: Attach the base

1. Sow the base onto the slipper
